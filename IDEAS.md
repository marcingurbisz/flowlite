## Parallel Execution (Idea)

FlowLite achieves parallelism through parent-child flow relationships.

### Parent-Child Flow Model

FlowLite implements parallel execution using a parent-child flow model where:

- Parent flows can start one or more child flows
- Child flows execute independently and in parallel
- Parent flows can wait for specific child flows at designated stages
- The parent flow continues its own execution while child flows run

### Diagram Example

The following diagram illustrates a typical parent-child flow pattern:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    ValidatingBasicInfo: ValidatingBasicInfo validateBasicInfo()
    [*] --> ValidatingBasicInfo
    
    state fork_state <<fork>>
    ValidatingBasicInfo --> fork_state
    
    fork_state --> RunningCreditCheck: Main Flow
    fork_state --> VerifyingIncome: startChildFlow(Income)
    
    RunningCreditCheck: RunningCreditCheck performCreditCheck()
    RunningCreditCheck --> ReviewingCreditHistory
    
    ReviewingCreditHistory: ReviewingCreditHistory analyzeCreditHistory()
    ReviewingCreditHistory --> EvaluatingInitialEligibility
    
    VerifyingIncome: VerifyingIncome verifyIncome()
    VerifyingIncome --> CalculatingDebtToIncome
    
    CalculatingDebtToIncome: CalculatingDebtToIncome calculateRatios()
    CalculatingDebtToIncome --> VerifyingEmployment
    
    VerifyingEmployment: VerifyingEmployment contactEmployer()
    VerifyingEmployment --> WaitingForIncomeVerification: Income child flow ends
    
    EvaluatingInitialEligibility: EvaluatingInitialEligibility assessInitialRisk()
    EvaluatingInitialEligibility --> WaitingForIncomeVerification
    
    WaitingForIncomeVerification: WaitingForIncomeVerification waitForChildFlows(Income)
    
    WaitingForIncomeVerification --> MakingFinalDecision
    MakingFinalDecision: MakingFinalDecision determineLoanApproval()
    
    MakingFinalDecision --> [*]
```

### API for Parallel Execution

```kotlin
// Starting a child flow
fun <T : Any, R : Any> FlowBuilder<T>.startChildFlow(
    childFlowId: String,
    initialStateMapper: (parentState: T) -> R,
): FlowBuilder<T>

// Processing child flow results
fun <T : Any, R : Any> FlowBuilder<T>.waitForChildFlow(
    childFlowId: String,
    resultMapper: (parentState: T, childResult: R) -> T,
): FlowBuilder<T>
```
