## TODO

WIP: 

* Introduce Flow<T : Any, S : Stage, E : Event> with NoEvent as default
* Check why Claude Code (cloud) had problem with build (network limitations?) and how he solved it.

Next:

* onTrue/onFalse as methods?
* do you see any improvments for flowlite API?
* Stages in pascal case?
* Implement history of changes
* Integrate Cockpit prototype
* Expose test instance publicly available 
* Optimistic locking based on modified fields?
* Tick using Azure Service Bus emulator? Different persistence? Mongo? Redis?
* Yet more coverage?
* Less output in the build? (from tests)
