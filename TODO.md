## Thread dump on render

Engine hangs after hours of operation (no business logs, only memory diagnostics). RSS stable (~344 MiB) — not OOM. Thread count grows from ~30 → ~125 during hang. Render eventually restarts on health check RST.

1. **Hourly VT-aware thread dump to logs** — dump should include Virtual Threads 
2. **Add pinned-thread tracing**

## [FOR HUMAN]
* Check on GUI:
  retryTrigger?: RetryTrigger | null;
  failedAttemptCount?: number | null;
  autoRetryMaxAttempts?: number | null;
  nextAutoRetryAt?: string | null;
  externalRetryAllowed?: boolean | null;
* Review engine once again
* Review CockpitPlaywrightTest

## [ON HOLD] Topics on hold for now
* Check sonar findings and decide if they should be fixed
* Visual testing - comparing screenshots before and after changes? Not sure about it because when agent can
see produced image maybe this be enough for visual inspection and comparing will not be needed?
* Check coverage and suggest modifications/new tests to cover it
* The GWT cleanup showed that the Cockpit Playwright spec now needs a small `RecordedPageSession` helper to keep browser setup/actions in `when` blocks while preserving failure screenshots/videos. If we add more browser scenarios, it may be worth introducing a tiny test DSL/helper layer for `open page -> act -> assert -> close` flows so future specs do not repeat the same session lifecycle/synchronization plumbing.
* Websocket for live refresh
